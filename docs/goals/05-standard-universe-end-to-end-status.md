# Goal 05 Status — Standard Universe End-to-End Integration

## Current state

`InProgress`

Goal 05 starts from the immutable Goal 04 completion snapshot. It closes the
gap between independently executable mechanic plans/reference battle
settlement and production end-to-end Activity plus combat execution.

## Batch ledger

| Batch | State | Evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `G05-P0-B1` | `Complete` | This row's containing commit | Froze the execution package, six observed Goal 04 integration gaps, an additive migration contract and 19 commit-sized batches. Goal 04 remains an immutable historical snapshot; Goal 05 explicitly requires real nested combat and atomic effect application without expanding into general ForkJoin. |
| `G05-P0-B2` | `Complete` | `node tools/goal05/verify-integration-probes.mjs`; `node tools/repository-check/run.mjs` | Froze the observable starting debt: two production reference-settlement callers, nine standalone Path entry points, two effect-plan-only noncombat entry points, seven physical nodes per domain, 37 acyclic templates/579 source nodes and the 4,058-node/5,993-edge compiled graph. The focused loop is capped at 180 seconds; every later batch must replace debt assertions with positive integration tests. |
| `G05-P1-B1` | `Complete` | `cargo test -p starclock-activity --test handler_registry`; `cargo test -p starclock-mode-universe --test handler_bundle`; focused Clippy; quick repository gate | Added bounded immutable Activity handler bundles, validated stable metadata/schema/dependencies, deterministic bundle/handler ordering, canonical SHA-256 registry identity and function-pointer execution returning ordinary Activity operations. The empty core and Standard Universe bundles compose without editing a central registry and reserve later P2 handler registrations. |
| `G05-P1-B2` | `Complete` | `cargo test -p starclock-activity --lib --tests --all-features`; `cargo test -p starclock-mode-universe --lib --tests --all-features`; focused Clippy; quick repository gate | Added bounded logical-scope definitions and transactional runtime state. The compiled Standard Universe topology binds each domain's seven physical room nodes to one logical `DomainVisit`: movement inside the domain preserves the visit identity, leaving closes it and later re-entry allocates a fresh deterministic visit sequence. Canonical state, hashes and filtered/debug views now cover active logical scopes; activities without logical scopes retain their prior encoding. |
| `G05-P1-B3` | `Complete` | `cargo test -p starclock-replay --lib --tests --all-features`; focused Clippy; quick repository gate | Added a bounded, strictly ordered consumed-component manifest with stable kind/ID/revision/digest, canonical SHA-256 root and first-divergence reporting. Added a component-addressed replay v2 envelope and total decoder while leaving the Goal 04 replay v1 codec and verifier unchanged. V2 validates its embedded component root before exposing records and no longer treats a physical bundle digest as the compatibility root. |
| `G05-P2-B1` | `Complete` | `cargo test -p starclock-activity -p starclock-mode-universe --lib --tests --all-features`; focused Clippy; quick repository gate | Added bounded source-attributed interaction bindings from `(node, offered outcome)` to immutable canonical payload and composed handler registration. External outcomes can no longer bypass the handler path through ordinary option selection. Handler-produced operations execute as a prefix to authored consumption/transition operations in one copied-state transaction; stale, unbound, unavailable, invalid-payload and operation-limit failures preserve authoritative state. Every Standard Universe room-selection outcome is bound, while actual noncombat content retains its source content payload for P2-B2/P2-B3 lowering. |

## Frozen findings

| ID | Finding | Required closure |
|---|---|---|
| `G05-F01` | Production CLI/agent full runs use `verified-reference-projection-v1`. | Execute actual `starclock-combat` battles and seal their projections. |
| `G05-F02` | Path/Blessing/Curio evaluators return proposals outside the combat resolver. | Compile proposals into validated combat contributions/operations. |
| `G05-F03` | Occurrence/service effect plans are not atomically applied by `submit_external_outcome`. | Bind handlers and apply costs/effects/transition in one Activity transaction. |
| `G05-F04` | Seven physical nodes model one domain while local state is Activity-scoped. | Add `DomainVisit` logical ownership and fresh revisit semantics. |
| `G05-F05` | Mode dispatch is represented by central runtime fields and family-specific methods. | Compose immutable handler/rule bundles. |
| `G05-F06` | Replay identity is coupled to manually assembled whole-catalog revisions. | Bind ordered consumed components and registry digests. |

## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-24 | Goal 04 remains a historical release and its evidence is not regenerated. | Goal 05 is an additive semantic/runtime revision, not retroactive relabeling. |
| 2026-07-24 | Do not implement general multi-pending tasks in Goal 05. | Standard Universe is sequential; this goal closes actual observed integration gaps. |
| 2026-07-24 | Reference battle projection is test-only after migration. | Production completion must prove real combat behavior. |
| 2026-07-24 | Retain documented approximations where exact public data is absent. | Integration must not fabricate authoritative values. |
